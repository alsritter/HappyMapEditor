# Why is Genergaming?


Genergaming is an editor that can edit game map generation games online. Once the map is drawn, it can be run online through a WebGL client written in Unity.

⚠ It is not suitable for mobile terminal, please use Chrome or Edge to open it.  
~~⚠ Because there are still some unfinished functions, so I will not expose the code for the moment~~
